# Tensorflow for old car price prediction
## Objective:
The aim of this project is to use a dataset of used cars and create a regression model that predicts the price of the car given the input data of those cars.
## Technique used:
There are different ways to solve this problem using Machine learning algorithms but I used deep learning neural networks to solve this problem using the TensorFlow framework and Keras API. The steps followed to achieve the trained model to predict the car prices were as followed:
  1. Importing the necessary packages
  2. Data Preparation and preprocessing( Converting the .csv to tensor and then creating train, validation and test set)
  3. Creating the model using Keras Sequential API
  4. Compiling the model by defining the optimizer, the loss function and the metric for performance evaluation
  5. Training and optimizing the model
  6. Evaluating and Testing the test dataset
  7. Carried out corrective measures like changing the number of epochs, the learning rate, the number of neurons in various layers,etc.

## Result:
A model was trained that could be used for the regression problem i.e. predicting the price of the used cars.
